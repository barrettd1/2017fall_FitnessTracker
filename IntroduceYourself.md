Hi, I am Danyelle Barrett and Iâ€™m a senior majoring in Computer Science. The courses I have taken so far in regards to computing are CS 1, 2, & 3, Assembly Language and Computer Architecture, Object- Oriented Programming, Language Processing, Discrete Mathematics for Computing, and Digital Logic Design. This semester, along with Web Programming, I will be taking Software Engineering, Operating Systems, and Microprocessor System Design. I did not know much about Computer Science before beginning my major, but I have learned so much in my time here. The language I am most familiar with is Java. I also have experience with C/C++ and Assembly Language. I recently taught myself HTML5 and CSS for this course through CodeAcademy and several other tutorials, and this summer I also began a tutorial package online to learn Python. I own a MacBook Pro, so I have experience working with both Mac OS and Windows. 

I think this course is going to be very valuable in my education. It is an area of computer science that I have not yet been exposed to in my courses, and I am eager to learn more about this vast and widely popular area of Web Programming. I think that the skills and knowledge I learn will make me more marketable in my job search come graduation in the Spring. It will give me more to list on my resume, which I will love! I obtained a fully paid scholarship to attend the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing 2017, taking place this October 3rd-7th, so I am very excited to see how topics mentioned in class may be discussed in more depth down at the conference in Orlando. There is also a huge career fair at the convention, so I will be much more confident going in to it knowing I have some extra skills and knowledge from this course!
